# Def13
Re-upload of old Reddit-crawling Discord bot from 2018 that probably does not work any longer. 
This project was the first time I ever touched programming other than an extremely shallow dive into Lua through Roblox. 
Feel free to use this to understand basic commands within Snoowrap and Discord.js. 

## To Use
Register bot accounts with both Discord and Reddit.

Create an imin.js file with the proper values as specified within bot.js.

Run bot.js using Node.js.
